## concat-cli

Just a simple wrapper around the [concat](https://www.npmjs.org/package/concat) module, to concatenate files via the command line, and support ** glob.



## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g concat-cli
```



## Usage

Pass the files to concatenate (-f or --files parameter) to the tool, and optionally and destination file (-o or --output parameter):

Uses the argument after -f flag to make a path to pass into the glob module.  If passed in through the command line, the path should be passed in as a string:

```bash
$ concat-cli -f 'path/to/js/**/*.js' -o bundle.js
```

If registering as an npm script (the main reason this module was created), it is not necessary to include the path a string.
